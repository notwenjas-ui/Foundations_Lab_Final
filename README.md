## 1. Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks

**The CIA Triad:** The key objectives of cybersecurity programs

**Confidentiality:** Ensures that the authorized user can see particular information

**Integrity:** Ensures that the information hasnt been modified and is trustworthy

**Availability:** Refers to the idea that authorized users have access to the information they need when they need it

**The AAA Framework:** The process of managing identity

**Authentication:** Verifies who you are (ex:username, password, biometrics)

**Authorization:** Determines what you are allowed to do

**Accounting:** Monitors and audits the access request

**Governance & Cybersecurity Roles:**

Governance refers to how the organization governs the way things are done. It dictates what is acceptable behavior. Can employees access files at home? Is it best practice to lock your work computer while you arent using it? Are these standards accepted as an organization. As cybersecurity practitioners, the goal is to protect data and its users. Governance provides a structured way of managing this data so that if there is a cybersecurity risk, it can be managed appropriately.

**Reflection:** Without governance, technical tools are just random tools without a goal. Governance establishes a framework that helps organizations guide the actions of cybersecurity practitioners. It makes sure that their efforts are aligned with teh objectives of the organization. GRC is the security domain that aligns most with today's material. When we discuss teh CIA, AAA, and the NIST cybersecurity framework, it all touches on how we manage cybersecurity risk.
